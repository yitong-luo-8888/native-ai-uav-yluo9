"""One-command health check for the Stage 1 stack.

Run this instead of following a setup guide by hand. It should answer "does
my environment work" with a plain-English PASS or a specific failure plus a
remediation line -- not a stack trace. See SETUP.md's troubleshooting index
for the failure modes this maps to.

Requires paho-mqtt (already needed for client/matplotlib_view.py -- install
client/requirements.txt into your venv before running this).
